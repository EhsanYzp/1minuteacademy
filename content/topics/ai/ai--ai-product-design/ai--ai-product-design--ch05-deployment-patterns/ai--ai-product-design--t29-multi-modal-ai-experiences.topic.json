      "text": "Design for the strongest modality: use images when visual context matters, audio for hands-free scenarios, and text for precision. Don't force multi-modal when single-modal works fine."

      "text": "Multi-modal adds complexity: larger payloads, slower responses, higher costs, and more failure modes. Each modality can fail independently. Design fallbacks for each."

      "text": "The best multi-modal experiences feel seamless: take a photo, get a text answer. Record a voice note, get a summary. The modality switch is invisible to the user."
