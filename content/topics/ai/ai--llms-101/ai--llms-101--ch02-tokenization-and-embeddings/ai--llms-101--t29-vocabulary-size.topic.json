      "text": "A larger vocabulary means common words and phrases get single tokens, so less computation per sentence. A smaller vocabulary means less memory and simpler training, but more tokens per sentence."

      "text": "Vocabulary size affects multilingual performance dramatically. English-centric vocabularies split Chinese or Arabic words into many tokens, making the model slower and less effective for those languages."
