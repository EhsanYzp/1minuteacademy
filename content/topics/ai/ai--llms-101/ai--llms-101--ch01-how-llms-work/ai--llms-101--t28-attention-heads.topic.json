      "text": "A transformer doesn't use one attention mechanism — it uses dozens running in parallel. Each 'head' learns to focus on different relationships: one tracks grammar, another coreference, another semantic similarity."

      "text": "Researchers found that some heads are so specialised you can name them: 'induction heads' copy patterns, 'previous-token heads' look one step back. Not all heads are equally useful — some can be pruned with little quality loss."
