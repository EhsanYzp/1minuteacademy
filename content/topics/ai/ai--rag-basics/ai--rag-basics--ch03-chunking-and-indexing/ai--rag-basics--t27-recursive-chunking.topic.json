      "text": "You split a document every 500 tokens. A paragraph about 'machine learning applications' gets cut in half — one chunk says 'applications include' and the other says 'healthcare and finance.' Neither chunk is useful alone."

      "text": "The algorithm: try splitting on '\\n\\n' (paragraphs). If any chunk is still too large, split those on '\\n' (lines). Still too large? Split on '. ' (sentences). This preserves semantic coherence."
