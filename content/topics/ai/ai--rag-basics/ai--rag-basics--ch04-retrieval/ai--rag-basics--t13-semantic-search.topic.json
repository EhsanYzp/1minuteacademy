      "text": "The user types 'how do I send back a product I bought?' Your keyword search for 'send back' returns nothing. Your knowledge base calls it 'returns.' Semantic search finds it anyway."

      "text": "This is why RAG works for real users: people describe things in their own words, not in your documentation's terminology. Semantic search bridges that vocabulary gap."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Semantic search can match too broadly. 'What's your refund policy?' might retrieve 'What's your privacy policy?' because the sentence structure is similar. Relevance scoring helps but isn't perfect."
