      "text": "A thumbnail sketch is 2 inches wide and takes 30 seconds. It's NOT a drawing — it's a THOUGHT written in shapes. Professionals do 20-50 thumbnails before starting a piece. Each one is a possible composition, tested cheaply."

      "text": "Thumbnail rules: small (2-3 inches), fast (30-60 seconds each), focused on composition (not detail), values only (no color — just dark/medium/light), and high volume (aim for 12-20 minimum). Speed prevents preciousness."

      "text": "Thumbnails externalize thinking: an idea in your head might seem brilliant, but drawn out, it might not work. Thumbnails let you TEST ideas visually before investing hours. They're creative experiments — most 'fail,' but the failures cost nothing."

      "text": "The best composition is rarely thumbnail #1 or #2 — those are the obvious ideas. Push to #15 or #20. Your brain exhausts clichés by #10 and starts producing genuinely original compositions. The magic is in volume."
