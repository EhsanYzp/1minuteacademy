      "text": "Mind mapping works because it's visual and associative: one idea triggers the next. Start with the central concept, write related ideas around it, then branch from THOSE. The connections at the outer edges are where original ideas live."

      "text": "'Worst idea' brainstorming is counterintuitively powerful: asking 'what's the worst solution?' removes the pressure of being good. People generate ideas freely — and then inverting the worst ideas often reveals genuinely brilliant approaches."

      "text": "Try all three: for the prompt 'design a poster about water conservation,' do a mind map (3 min), SCAMPER on your best idea (3 min), and random word association with the word 'telescope' (3 min). Compare results — the unexpected connections win."
