      "text": "Twitter's 280 characters. Haiku's 5-7-5 syllables. Painting with only 3 colors. Constraints seem limiting — but they're actually creativity's secret weapon. The brain produces more original work when given boundaries than when given total freedom."

      "text": "Self-imposed constraints are just as effective as external ones. Challenge yourself: 'draw only with my non-dominant hand,' 'paint this scene in 15 minutes,' 'use only blue and orange.' These voluntary rules unlock creativity that freedom can't."

      "text": "Draw a portrait using only straight lines (no curves allowed). The constraint forces creative problem-solving: how do you represent a curved cheek with straight segments? The solution will look nothing like your usual work — and that's the point."

      "text": "Freedom says 'do anything.' Constraints say 'solve THIS.' The brain does its best work solving puzzles, not wandering."
