      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The challenge-skill sweet spot: too easy = boredom. Too hard = anxiety. Flow lives in between — where the task stretches your abilities just enough. As your skills grow, you need harder challenges to re-enter flow."

      "text": "Flow can't be forced, but it can be INVITED: remove distractions (phone off), warm up first (don't expect flow in the first 15 minutes), choose the right difficulty level, and set a clear intention for the session."

      "text": "Set up a creative session: silence your phone, choose a project that's challenging but achievable, set a timer for 60 minutes (but don't check it), and start working. If flow comes, you'll forget the timer exists."
