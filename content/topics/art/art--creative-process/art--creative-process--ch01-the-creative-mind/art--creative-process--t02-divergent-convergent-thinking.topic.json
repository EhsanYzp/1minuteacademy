      "text": "Divergent thinking: quantity over quality. Wild ideas welcome. No criticism. Build on others' ideas. Aim for volume — 20 ideas, 50 ideas. The goal is to explore the full possibility space before narrowing."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Convergent thinking: now evaluate. Which ideas are feasible? Which are original? Which serve the goal? Apply criteria and select the strongest 2-3 ideas. This is where judgment belongs — AFTER the ideation phase, not during."

      "text": "The best ideas usually appear AFTER the obvious ones. Ideas 1-10 are predictable. Ideas 11-20 are where clichés run out. Ideas 21-30 are where genuine originality lives. Most people stop at idea #5 — push past the obvious."

      "text": "Given a design prompt ('design a chair'), generate 20 ideas in 10 minutes — no judging. Then switch to convergent mode: star your top 3. The ideas that surprise you most will almost certainly come from the later half of the list."
