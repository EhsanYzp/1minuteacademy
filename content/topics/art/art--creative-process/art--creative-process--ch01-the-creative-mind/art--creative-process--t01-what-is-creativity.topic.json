      "text": "The creative process has stages: 1) Preparation (absorb information and ideas), 2) Incubation (let your subconscious work), 3) Illumination (the 'aha' moment), 4) Verification (test and refine the idea). It's not random — it's a cycle."

      "text": "Creativity is combinatory: new ideas are combinations of existing ideas in unexpected ways. Steve Jobs said 'creativity is just connecting things.' The more diverse your inputs (books, experiences, disciplines), the more connections you can make."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Studies show that creativity peaks not in moments of relaxation, but in moments of constraint. Deadlines, limited materials, and rules force the brain to find novel solutions. Complete freedom often paralyzes — constraint liberates."

      "text": "Try this: combine two random, unrelated words (e.g., 'ocean' + 'library'). Spend 5 minutes generating ideas that connect them. You'll produce at least 3-5 genuinely interesting concepts. That's creativity — forced connections between unrelated things."
