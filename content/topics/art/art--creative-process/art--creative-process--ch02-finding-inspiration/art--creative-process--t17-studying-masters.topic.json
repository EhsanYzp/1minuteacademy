      "text": "Every great artist studied those who came before: Picasso studied Velázquez. Van Gogh studied Japanese prints. Miyazaki studied European illustration. Studying the masters isn't lack of originality — it's building on centuries of accumulated wisdom."

      "text": "How to study: master copies (reproduce their work to understand their decisions), analysis (break down their composition, color, values, and edges), comparison (how did different masters solve the same problem?), and written notes (articulate what you learned)."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Master copies teach by forcing your hand to make their decisions: why did they put the darkest dark THERE? Why is that edge soft? Why only three colors? You discover answers through the physical act of recreation that analysis alone can't reveal."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Study broadly: don't only study artists in your medium. A digital illustrator can learn composition from Rembrandt, color from Matisse, and storytelling from Norman Rockwell. Principles transcend medium — wisdom is universal."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Choose one artwork you admire. Spend 30 minutes copying it — not for a perfect reproduction, but to understand the decisions. After copying, write three things you learned about their approach. This one exercise teaches more than a textbook."

      "text": "Study the masters not to paint like them, but to understand what they understood. Then use that understanding to paint like YOU."

      "It's required in art school",
