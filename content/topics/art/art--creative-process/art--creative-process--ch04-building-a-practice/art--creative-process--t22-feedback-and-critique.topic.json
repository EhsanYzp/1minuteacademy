      "text": "Sharing your work and hearing 'it doesn't work' is painful. But feedback is the fastest accelerator of growth — faster than practice alone. The trick is learning to separate useful critique from useless noise and your art from your identity."

      "text": "Good feedback is specific: 'the value contrast is flat' (actionable) vs 'it's not great' (useless). Seek feedback from people who can articulate WHY something works or doesn't — not just whether they like it."

      "text": "The separation principle: you are NOT your art. A critique of your painting is not a critique of you as a person. This emotional separation is essential — and it gets easier with practice. The more you share, the less fragile you become."

      "text": "The most dangerous feedback is ONLY positive. 'It's great!' feels good but teaches nothing. Seek people who will tell you what's NOT working — those are the people who'll accelerate your growth. Uncomfortable feedback is the most valuable kind."
