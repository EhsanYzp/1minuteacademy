      "text": "A jazz trick: start playing anything — even random notes. The ear catches something interesting and you follow it. Apply this to art: make random marks, find something interesting, and develop it. Creation can begin with randomness."

      "text": "Grab a page and make 10 completely random marks: lines, dots, scribbles, blobs. Now look at them and find a creature, a landscape, or a face hiding in the randomness. Develop it with intentional marks. You just created something from nothing — via chaos."
