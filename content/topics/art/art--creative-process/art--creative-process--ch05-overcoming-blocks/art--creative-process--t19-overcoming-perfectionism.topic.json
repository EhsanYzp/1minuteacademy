      "text": "Perfectionism says: 'If it's not perfect, don't share it. If you can't do it perfectly, don't start.' This voice has killed more art than any lack of talent. Perfectionism isn't high standards — it's fear wearing a mask."

      "text": "The antidote: volume over quality. Make 100 small pieces instead of agonizing over 1 perfect piece. The 100 pieces will teach you more, and by piece #80, you'll be producing work better than the 'perfect' piece you would have abandoned at attempt #3."
