      "text": "The blank page stares back. Every idea feels stupid. You've been sitting for an hour and nothing comes. Creative block feels like a wall — but it's usually a symptom, not a disease. Understanding the cause reveals the cure."

      "text": "Common causes: perfectionism (standards too high to start), fear (of failure, judgment, or not being good enough), burnout (creative exhaustion from overwork), information overload (too many inputs, too few outputs), or unclear goals (don't know what to make)."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The biggest revelation: creative block is usually an EMOTIONAL problem, not an intellectual one. You don't lack ideas — you lack the confidence/energy/clarity to act on them. Treating the emotion, not the 'missing idea,' resolves most blocks."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Paradoxically, trying harder makes blocks worse. The pressure to produce compounds the anxiety. Often, the best cure is to stop trying entirely — go for a walk, work on something unrelated, or sleep. The subconscious continues working."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Next time you feel blocked, diagnose the cause: are you afraid (of what?), tired (rest), overwhelmed (simplify), or bored (change subjects)? Name the emotion specifically. Named emotions are manageable; unnamed ones are terrifying."

      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "A creative block isn't a lack of ideas. It's something standing between you and the ideas. Name it, address it, and the ideas flow again."
