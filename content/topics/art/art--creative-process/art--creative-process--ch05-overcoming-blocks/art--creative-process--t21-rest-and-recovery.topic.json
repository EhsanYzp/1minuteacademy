      "text": "Archimedes in the bathtub. Newton under the apple tree. Your best idea in the shower. Breakthroughs happen during REST — not during focused work. The subconscious processes information during downtime, and insights emerge when you stop forcing them."

      "text": "The incubation effect: after intensely working on a problem, stepping away allows the default mode network (your brain's 'wandering' system) to make connections your focused mind couldn't. Sleep, walks, and showers activate this network."

      "text": "Creative burnout is real: sustained high output without rest depletes creative energy. Signs: everything feels boring, quality drops, you resent the work. The cure is NOT pushing harder — it's genuinely resting (not scrolling social media — that's more input, not rest)."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "True rest is input-free: no screens, no podcasts, no reading. Walk in nature. Sit quietly. Stare at a wall. Boring? Yes. But your brain uses that emptiness to process, organize, and connect the massive input you've been feeding it."

      "text": "Next time you're stuck on a creative problem: work intensely for 25 minutes, then take a 15-minute walk with NO phone. Don't think about the problem. When you return, write down the first idea that comes to mind. It will likely surprise you."
