      "text": "A large white canvas with a single black stripe. A steel cube on a gallery floor. Minimalism stripped art to its absolute essentials: shape, color, material, space. Nothing to interpret — just the object itself."

      "text": "Minimalism (1960s-70s): Donald Judd (metal boxes), Dan Flavin (fluorescent light arrangements), Frank Stella ('What you see is what you see'), Agnes Martin (subtle grids). Industrial materials, geometric forms, no emotion."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The motto: 'Less is more.' By removing symbolism, narrative, and emotion, Minimalism forced viewers to experience the artwork as a physical object in space — its size, material, relationship to the room and your body."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Minimalism seemed cold but was actually radical: it rejected the art market's obsession with the artist's hand and emotional expression. The art wasn't about the artist — it was about your experience of the object."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Minimalism's influence is everywhere: Apple's product design, modern architecture, Scandinavian interiors, fashion basics. The idea that removing everything unnecessary reveals the essential is now a dominant design philosophy."

      "text": "Minimalism proved that the less you put in, the more the viewer brings. Emptiness is full of possibility."
