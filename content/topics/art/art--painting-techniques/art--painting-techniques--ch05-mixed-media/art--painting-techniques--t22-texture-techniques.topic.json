      "text": "A painting's surface should be as interesting up close as it is from afar. Texture techniques add physical variety: scratches, dots, sponge marks, and scraping — surfaces that invite touch and reward close inspection."

      "text": "Techniques: sgraffito (scratch through wet paint to reveal color beneath), stippling (dab with brush tip for dots), sponging (dab with sponge for organic texture), dry brush (drag almost-dry brush for rough strokes), and stamping (press objects into wet paint)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Texture variation creates visual interest: smooth passages make textured passages more exciting, and vice versa. A painting that's ALL texture is as monotonous as one that's ALL smooth. Contrast is key."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Found-object stamping: press bubble wrap, leaves, corrugated cardboard, or string into wet paint. The real-world texture transfers to the canvas, creating patterns that would be impossible to paint by hand — and uniquely organic."

      "text": "On a practice surface, try 6 different texture techniques side by side: sgraffito, stippling, sponging, dry brush, stamping with bubble wrap, and palette knife scraping. You'll build a texture vocabulary for future paintings."

      "text": "Texture is the painting's tactile dimension — what you'd feel if you could touch it. Make the surface as expressive as the image."
