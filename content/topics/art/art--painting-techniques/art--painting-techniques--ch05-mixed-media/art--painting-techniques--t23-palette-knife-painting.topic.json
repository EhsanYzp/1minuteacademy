      "text": "Put down the brush. Pick up the palette knife. Spread paint like butter on toast. Scrape it back. Smear, drag, dab. Palette knife painting is physical, bold, and liberating — it produces marks that brushes simply cannot make."

      "text": "Techniques: flat spreading (large smooth areas), edge dragging (thin lines), dabbing (small textured shapes — perfect for foliage), scraping (reveal layers beneath), and mixing on canvas (blend colors where they're applied)."

    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The knife's advantage: it forces simplification. You can't do tiny details with a broad blade, so you work in bold masses and shapes. This constraint produces paintings with an energetic, impressionistic quality that over-detailed brush work often lacks."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Knife painting uses MORE paint than brush painting — you're spreading thick layers. But it's faster: one knife stroke covers area that would take 20 brush strokes. Speed + boldness = paintings with life."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Paint a simple landscape using ONLY a palette knife: spread the sky, scrape in distant mountains, dab foreground foliage. No brushes allowed. The resulting painting will have an energy and texture that surprises you."

      "It uses less paint",
      "It forces simplification and bold mark-making, preventing overworking and producing energetic results",
      "It's more precise than a brush",
