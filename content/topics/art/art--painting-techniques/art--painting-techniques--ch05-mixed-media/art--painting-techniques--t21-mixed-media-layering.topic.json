      "text": "Ink lines over watercolor washes. Acrylic paint over collage paper. Pencil details over digital prints. Mixed media means no rules about what goes together — only the question: does it serve the artwork?"

      "text": "Layer order matters: typically porous/transparent layers first (watercolor, ink washes), then opaque layers (acrylic, gouache), then surface details (pen, pencil, markers). Each layer adds information and texture."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The adhesion rule: make sure each layer bonds to the one beneath. Acrylic sticks to almost everything. Oil ONLY sticks over lean/dry surfaces (not over acrylic easily). Watercolor doesn't stick over acrylic. Know the compatibility."

      "text": "The most exciting mixed media combinations are unexpected: embroidery over a painting, gold leaf over graphite, wax resist under watercolor. Breaking conventional medium boundaries creates effects no single medium can achieve."

    "climax": {
      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Create one piece using at least 3 mediums: a watercolor or ink wash background, collage elements glued over it, and pen or paint details on top. Each layer adds richness, and the combination is uniquely your own."
