      "text": "Cut paper, torn magazine pages, fabric scraps, old letters — collage introduces real-world textures and imagery into painting. Picasso and Braque invented it in 1912, and it blew open what a painting could be."

      "text": "Collage materials: newspaper, tissue paper (transparent layering), fabric, printed photos, maps, packaging, dried leaves, sand, and anything flat enough to adhere. Adhesive: matte medium (for paper), gel medium (for heavier materials)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Collage forces compositional thinking: you're arranging shapes, not drawing them. This is liberating — you can audition compositions by MOVING pieces before gluing. It's physical Photoshop, and the results have a tactile quality digital can't match."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "The power of collage: combining unrelated materials creates unexpected connections. A piece of a love letter under a painted ocean. A map fragment becoming a landscape. The juxtaposition creates meaning that neither element has alone."

    "climax": {
      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Gather 10 different paper materials (newspaper, colored paper, old book pages). Cut/tear them into shapes. Arrange a landscape composition without drawing. Glue it down, then paint over parts. Collage + paint = more than either alone."

    "punchline": {
      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Collage breaks the tyranny of the blank canvas. You start with existing materials and transform them — creation from curation."

      "It's cheaper than paint",
