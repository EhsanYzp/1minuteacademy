      "text": "Van Gogh's swirling skies. Rembrandt's jeweled highlights. Paint piled so thick it casts real shadows. Impasto turns a painting into a relief sculpture — the surface itself becomes expressive, not just the image."

      "visual": "🖌️",
      "text": "Tools: palette knife (sharp, geometric marks), stiff bristle brush (rough, directional marks), or fingers (organic, smooth blending). Apply paint thickly — straight from the tube or mixed with impasto medium for extra body."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Impasto is most effective for HIGHLIGHTS and focal areas. Thick paint in lights, thin paint in shadows — this creates a physical hierarchy where the painting's highest points are literally closest to the light, catching real-world illumination."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "The texture of impasto adds a time dimension: you can see every stroke, every knife drag, every moment of the artist's hand. This visible process connects the viewer to the act of creation in a way that smooth painting can't."
    },
    "climax": {
      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Paint a simple flower: use thin, smooth paint for the background and shadows. Then load a palette knife with thick paint and sculpt the highlights in one bold stroke each. The contrast between thin and thick creates powerful dimension."

      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Impasto is where painting becomes sculpture. The canvas gains a third dimension."

      "In the shadows for depth",
