      "text": "Oil paint: pigment suspended in drying oil (usually linseed). It's been the dominant medium since the 15th century for one reason — nothing else blends as smoothly, layers as richly, or glows as deeply."

      "text": "Key properties: slow drying (hours to days — perfect for blending), rich color (high pigment load), buttery texture (satisfying to push around), and longevity (500-year-old oil paintings still look vibrant)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Oil's secret: slow drying means extended working time. You can blend seamlessly on the canvas for hours. Smooth skin tones, atmospheric gradients, and photorealistic details are all easier in oil because the paint stays wet."

      "text": "The trade-off: oil requires solvents (turpentine or odorless mineral spirits) for cleanup and thinning, which have health concerns. Modern alternatives exist (water-mixable oils, solvent-free mediums), but traditional oil painting needs ventilation."

      "text": "Put a dab of oil paint on a palette. Come back in 4 hours — it's still workable. Try blending two colors together with a soft brush. The smooth, buttery transition is oil's defining experience — nothing else feels quite like it."
