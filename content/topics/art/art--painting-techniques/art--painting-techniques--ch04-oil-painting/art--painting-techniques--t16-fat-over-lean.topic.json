      "text": "Old oil paintings crack. Not all — just the ones where the artist broke a simple rule: fat over lean. Each successive layer must contain MORE oil (fat) than the one beneath. Ignore this and your painting self-destructs."

    "buildup": {
      "visual": "📐",
      "text": "Why it matters: oilier layers dry slower and remain flexible. Leaner layers dry faster and become rigid. If a rigid lean layer sits ON TOP of a flexible fat layer, the rigid top cracks as the bottom layer shifts during drying."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Practice: first layers — thin paint with solvent (lean, fast-drying, rigid). Middle layers — paint with less solvent (medium). Final layers — paint with added oil or medium (fat, slow-drying, flexible). Each layer is oilier than the last."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Alla prima (one-session) oil painting bypasses this rule entirely — if everything is wet at once, there are no layers to conflict. Fat over lean only matters for multi-session paintings where earlier layers dry between sessions."

    "climax": {
      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Plan a painting in three layers: 1) thin, solvent-heavy underpainting (lean — dry overnight). 2) Standard paint consistency (medium). 3) Final touches with added medium or oil (fat). Your painting will stay intact for centuries."

      "Use thick paint over thin",
