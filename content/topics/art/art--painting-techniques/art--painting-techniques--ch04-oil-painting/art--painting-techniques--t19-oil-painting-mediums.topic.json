      "text": "Oil paint straight from the tube has one consistency. Add linseed oil — it flows like silk. Add turpentine — it thins like watercolor. Add Liquin — it dries in a day instead of a week. Mediums transform the paint to match your needs."

      "text": "Common mediums: linseed oil (adds fat, increases flow and gloss), turpentine/OMS (thins paint, speeds drying — for lean early layers), stand oil (thicker linseed, levels brushstrokes), Liquin (fast drying, increases flow), and damar varnish (for protective final coating)."

      "text": "A basic medium recipe: 1 part stand oil + 1 part turpentine (or OMS). This gives a smooth, medium-consistency paint that dries in 1-2 days. Adjust the ratio: more oil = fatter/slower, more solvent = leaner/faster."

      "text": "Modern solvent-free alternatives exist: walnut oil (replaces linseed), spike lavender oil (replaces turpentine), and water-mixable oil paints (clean up with water). Healthy oil painting is absolutely possible without toxic solvents."

      "To make it dry faster",
