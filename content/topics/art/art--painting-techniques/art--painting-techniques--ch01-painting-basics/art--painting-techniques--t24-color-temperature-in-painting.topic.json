      "text": "Golden sunlight (warm) creates blue-purple shadows (cool). An overcast day (cool light) creates warm shadows. Light and shadow are ALWAYS opposite temperatures. This rule creates the color harmony that makes paintings vibrate with life."

      "text": "The principle: if the light source is warm (sunlight, tungsten), shadows lean cool (blue, violet, green). If the light source is cool (overcast, fluorescent), shadows lean warm (orange, red-brown). They complement each other."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Why it works: warm/cool contrast creates visual vibration — the colors push against each other optically. Paintings with this temperature contrast feel luminous and alive. Paintings where light and shadow are the same temperature feel flat."

      "text": "Beginners make shadows by adding black. Pros make shadows by adding the COMPLEMENT (cool) of the light color. Shadows aren't the absence of light — they're the presence of reflected environment. They have their own color."
