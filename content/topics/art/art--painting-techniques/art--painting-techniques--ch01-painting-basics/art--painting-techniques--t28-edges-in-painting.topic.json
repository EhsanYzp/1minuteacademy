      "text": "Look at a Sargent painting: razor-sharp edges on the face, melting soft edges on the clothing, lost edges where the figure dissolves into shadow. Edges are a painting's focus system — they tell the viewer where to look."

      "visual": "📐",
      "text": "Hard edges: maximum contrast, sharp boundary (focal points, key features). Soft edges: gradual transition (turning forms, non-essential areas). Lost edges: boundary disappears entirely — two areas merge (deep shadows, unimportant edges)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The eye is drawn to the hardest edge in a painting — just like it's drawn to the sharpest focus in a photograph. By controlling edges, you control attention. Hard edges at the focal point, soft and lost edges everywhere else."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Most amateur paintings have too many hard edges — every boundary is sharp. This creates a 'coloring book' look and gives equal attention to everything. The fix: soften 80% of your edges. Hard edges become precious and powerful."
    },
    "climax": {
      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Paint a portrait. While wet, soften EVERY edge with a clean brush. Then selectively re-harden only the most important edges: the eyes, the light-shadow boundary on the nose, key contours. The result is painterly and focused."
    },
    "punchline": {
      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Edges are the volume dial for attention. Hard edges shout 'LOOK HERE.' Soft edges whisper 'not important.' Lost edges say 'forget I exist.'"
