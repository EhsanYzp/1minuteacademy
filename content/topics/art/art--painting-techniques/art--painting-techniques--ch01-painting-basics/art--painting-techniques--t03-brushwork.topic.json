      "text": "Brush types: flat (rectangular marks, sharp edges, good for blocking), round (pointed, versatile, good for detail), filbert (oval tip, soft blending), fan (splayed, for textures like grass/hair), palette knife (thick, sculptural paint application)."

      "text": "The biggest beginner mistake: using small brushes for everything. Start with the LARGEST brush that will fit the area. Big brushes force bold, confident marks and prevent fussy overworking. Switch to smaller brushes only for final details."
