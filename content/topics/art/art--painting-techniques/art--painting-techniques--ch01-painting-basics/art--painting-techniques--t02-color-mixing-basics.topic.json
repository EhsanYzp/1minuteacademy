      "text": "Primaries: red, yellow, blue (can't be mixed from other colors). Secondaries: orange, green, purple (mixed from two primaries). Tertiaries: red-orange, yellow-green, etc. (primary + adjacent secondary). This is the basic color wheel."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The secret: use a warm AND a cool version of each primary. Warm red (cadmium — leans orange) + cool blue (phthalo — leans green) = muddy purple. Cool red (alizarin — leans purple) + warm blue (ultramarine — leans purple) = vibrant purple."

      "text": "White is the most-used color in painting — it lightens everything (tints). But adding white also reduces saturation and shifts hue. A better approach for lighter values: start lighter or use the color of the light source as the highlight color."
