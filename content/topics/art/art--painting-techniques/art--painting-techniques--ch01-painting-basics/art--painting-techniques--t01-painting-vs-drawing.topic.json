      "text": "Drawing builds form with lines — edges, contours, boundaries. Painting builds form with MASSES — shapes of color and value placed next to each other. The shift from line-thinking to mass-thinking is the fundamental leap from drawing to painting."

      "text": "A drawer outlines an apple, then fills it in. A painter sees a dark red shape, a bright highlight shape, a shadow shape, and a reflected light shape — four shapes placed together that read as 'apple' without any outline."

    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Painting's key insight: edges emerge naturally where two different-value shapes meet. You don't need to draw them. A light shape next to a dark shape creates an edge. A gradual transition creates a soft form. Shapes do everything."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Many beginners paint by coloring inside drawn lines — essentially making colored drawings. True painting starts when you ABANDON lines entirely and work only with color shapes. This feels scary but it's the breakthrough moment."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Try painting a simple object (an egg, a mug) WITHOUT drawing any lines first. Start with the biggest, darkest shape, then add lighter shapes on top. Edges appear automatically. It's like building with blocks instead of wire."

      "text": "Drawing thinks in edges. Painting thinks in masses. The transition is one of art's most important mental shifts."

      "Painting uses color while drawing doesn't",
