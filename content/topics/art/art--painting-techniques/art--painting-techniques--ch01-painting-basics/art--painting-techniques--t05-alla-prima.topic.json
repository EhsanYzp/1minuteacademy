      "text": "Alla prima means 'at the first attempt' — painting completed in one session, wet into wet, with no waiting for layers to dry. It's fast, energetic, and produces paintings with a spontaneous vitality that multi-session work often lacks."

      "text": "Process: block in the big shapes quickly (largest brush, biggest value/color areas first), then refine — adding details, correcting colors, adjusting edges — all while the paint is wet. Speed prevents overworking."

      "text": "Alla prima forces decisive brushwork: each stroke must be intentional because reworking wet paint creates mud. This constraint develops confidence. Plan the stroke, commit, and leave it. Three strokes are better than thirty."

      "text": "The Impressionists championed alla prima — painting outdoors in one session to capture fleeting light. Monet's haystacks, Sargent's watercolors, and Sorolla's beach scenes all share the energetic spontaneity of direct painting."
