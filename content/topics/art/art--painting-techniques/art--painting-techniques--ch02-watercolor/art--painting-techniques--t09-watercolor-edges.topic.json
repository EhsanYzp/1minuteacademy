      "visual": "🔲",
      "text": "A hard edge snaps to attention. A soft edge whispers away. A 'lost' edge disappears entirely, merging two areas into one. Edge control is what separates good watercolorists from great ones — it's the vocabulary of focus."

      "visual": "📐",
      "text": "Hard edges: paint on dry paper — crisp and defined (focal points, sharp details). Soft edges: paint on damp paper or soften with a clean damp brush — gentle transitions (backgrounds, atmospheric areas). Lost edges: same value touches — boundary vanishes."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The edge hierarchy: hard edges draw the eye (use at focal point). Soft edges recede (use for atmosphere and backgrounds). Lost edges create mystery (use where you want areas to merge). A painting needs ALL three."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Beginners make ALL edges hard, creating a coloring-book look. Professionals vary edges constantly — hard at the focal point, soft and lost everywhere else. This variation creates the eye-movement and breath that makes watercolor magical."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Paint a simple flower: hard edges on the closest petals (sharp, in focus), soft edges on the farther petals (slightly out of focus), and let some edges disappear into the background entirely (lost). One flower, three types of edges, maximum depth."
    },
    "punchline": {
      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Edges are the volume control for attention. Hard edges shout. Soft edges whisper. Lost edges silence."

    "question": "Why should a painting include a variety of hard, soft, and lost edges?",
    "options": [
      "It's a traditional requirement",
      "Varied edges guide the viewer's eye, create depth, and prevent a flat, coloring-book appearance",
      "Hard edges are always better",
      "Soft edges use less paint"
