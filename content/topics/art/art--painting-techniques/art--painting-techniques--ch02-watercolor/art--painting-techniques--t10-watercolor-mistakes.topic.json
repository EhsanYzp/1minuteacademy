      "text": "While wet: blot with a tissue (absorbs excess paint), lift with a clean damp brush (removes paint), or spray with water and tilt (redirects flow). While dry: scrub gently with a stiff damp brush (lifts dried paint — not all pigments lift equally)."

      "text": "Some pigments are 'staining' (permanent, difficult to lift: phthalo blue, alizarin crimson) and some are 'non-staining' (lift easily: cobalt blue, raw sienna). Know your pigments' properties before you start — it affects recoverability."

      "text": "Deliberately create 'mistakes' on a practice sheet: drips, blooms, splotches. Then try to turn each one into something intentional — a flower, a rock, a cloud. You'll discover that watercolor mistakes are often half-finished effects."
