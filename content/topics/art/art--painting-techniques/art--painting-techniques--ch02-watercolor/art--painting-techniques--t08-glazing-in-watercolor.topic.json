      "text": "A single wash of blue is flat. But layer a transparent yellow over it and you get a luminous green — richer and more vibrant than mixing green on the palette. This is glazing: layering transparent washes to build complex color."

      "text": "How it works: paint a wash and let it dry COMPLETELY. Then paint another thin, transparent wash over it. The layers optically mix — light passes through the top layer, through the bottom layer, bounces off the paper, and back through both."

    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Glazing builds depth: shadows become richer with each glaze. Colors become more complex. The effect is luminous because the color comes from light passing through multiple transparent layers — like stained glass."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "The critical rule: each layer MUST be completely dry before adding the next. If you paint over damp paint, you'll lift the previous layer and create mud. Patience is the only tool that makes glazing work."

      "text": "Paint a simple shape with a light wash. Let it dry. Add a second wash over part of it. Let it dry. Add a third. You'll see three distinct values — all from one color, layered. This is watercolor's version of 3D printing."

      "text": "Glazing is painting with light. Each transparent layer adds depth that opaque paint simply cannot achieve."
