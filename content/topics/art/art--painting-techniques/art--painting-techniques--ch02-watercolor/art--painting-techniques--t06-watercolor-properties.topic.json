      "text": "Watercolor is the most transparent painting medium — light passes through the paint and bounces off the white paper beneath, creating a luminous glow that no other medium can match. But water has a mind of its own."

      "text": "Key properties: transparency (light shines through layers), granulation (pigment settles into paper texture), flow (water carries pigment in unpredictable ways), and permanence (once dry, hard to change — you can't paint light over dark)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Watercolor works BACKWARDS compared to oil/acrylic: you preserve lights (the white paper) and build up darks. The lightest value in a watercolor is unpainted paper. This means planning your lights BEFORE starting."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Watercolor's 'happy accidents' — blooms, runs, unexpected blending — are features, not bugs. The best watercolorists work WITH the medium's unpredictability, embracing what the water does and incorporating it into the painting."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Wet a piece of watercolor paper and drop different colors onto it. Watch them bloom, mix, and flow. Then let it dry. The result will have effects you couldn't have planned — and that's watercolor's magic."

      "text": "Watercolor isn't painted — it's guided. You make suggestions; the water decides."
