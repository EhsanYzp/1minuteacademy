    "hook": {
      "visual": "🌊",
      "text": "Wet the paper. Touch a loaded brush to the surface. Watch the color bloom outward in a soft, organic shape with no hard edges. This is wet-on-wet — watercolor's most atmospheric and unpredictable technique."

      "text": "The wetness spectrum: soaking wet (paint flows far, very soft), damp (paint flows moderately), and barely wet (paint barely spreads, some edge control). Different wetness levels create different effects."

    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Timing is everything: too wet and the paint disappears into a watery puddle. Too dry and hard edges appear. The 'sweet spot' is a satin sheen on the paper — not puddling, not matte. Watch the surface shine to judge wetness."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Wet-on-wet creates beautiful backgrounds, skies, and atmospheric effects — but it's nearly impossible to control precisely. The professional approach: use wet-on-wet for soft backgrounds, then add sharp details with wet-on-dry on top."
    },
    "climax": {
      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Paint a simple sky: wet the top half of the paper, drop in blue and let it flow. While still damp, add a darker blue at the top for gradation. Let it dry, then paint sharp tree silhouettes on dry paper over it. Soft + sharp = drama."

    "punchline": {
      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Wet-on-wet is controlled chaos. Master the timing and you gain the most ethereal effects in all of painting."
