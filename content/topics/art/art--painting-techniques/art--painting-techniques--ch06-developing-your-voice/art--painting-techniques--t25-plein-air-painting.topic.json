      "text": "Set up an easel outside, squeeze out paint, and race against the changing light. Plein air painting is working directly from nature — no photographs, no studio comfort. Just you, the landscape, and the sun moving faster than you'd like."

      "text": "Essentials: portable easel, limited palette (5-6 colors max), small canvases (8×10 or smaller), a hat, and a water bottle. Limit your session to 2 hours — the light changes too much beyond that."

      "text": "Plein air's gift: it teaches you to see light accurately. Photographs flatten and distort color. Your eyes see the full dynamic range, the true color relationships, and the subtle atmospheric effects. Painting from life is painting from truth."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Plein air paintings are studies, not masterpieces — and that's the point. They capture a moment of light with an energy and truth that studio paintings from photos rarely achieve. Many artists use plein air studies as reference for larger studio work."

      "text": "Go outside with a small canvas and a limited palette. Give yourself 60 minutes to capture a scene. Don't try to paint every leaf — capture the big shapes of light and shadow. The time pressure produces your most honest painting."

      "text": "Plein air is where painting meets reality. The sun waits for no artist — and that urgency creates magic."
