      "text": "Acrylic paint dries in minutes, can mimic both watercolor and oil, cleans up with water, and sticks to almost anything. It's the most versatile painting medium ever invented — and it was only created in the 1950s."

      "text": "Key properties: water-soluble when wet (easy cleanup), waterproof when dry (permanent layers), fast-drying (minutes, not days), versatile (thin like watercolor OR thick like oil), and flexible when dry (doesn't crack)."

      "text": "Acrylic shifts slightly darker as it dries — the wet paint looks lighter than the final result. This color shift is small but noticeable. Experienced acrylic painters mix colors slightly lighter than desired to compensate."

      "text": "Acrylic's fast drying is both its greatest strength and challenge. Strength: you can layer quickly without waiting. Challenge: blending on canvas is difficult because the paint dries before you can blend. Retarder medium slows drying."
