      "text": "Straight from the tube, acrylic is versatile. Add mediums and it becomes ANYTHING: thick like frosting (modeling paste), thin like ink (flow medium), slow-drying (retarder), textured (pumice gel), or glass-like (pouring medium)."

      "text": "Essential mediums: matte medium (reduces gloss, good for glazing), gel medium (thickens paint for impasto), retarder (slows drying), flow medium (thins without losing color strength), and gesso (primes surfaces)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The key distinction: thinning with water reduces paint strength and adhesion. Thinning with medium maintains paint integrity. For thin washes, use a mix of water AND medium. For heavy textures, use gel medium, not more paint."

      "text": "Modeling paste is liquid sculpture: apply it thick with a palette knife, let it dry, then paint over it. You can create 3D textures — tree bark, stone walls, waves — that cast actual shadows. Your painting becomes a relief sculpture."

      "text": "Take the same acrylic paint and create four different effects on a test surface: thin watercolor wash (flow medium), standard brushwork, thick impasto (gel medium), and 3D texture (modeling paste). One paint, four completely different media."

    "question": "Why is it better to thin acrylic with medium rather than water?",
    "options": [
      "Medium is cheaper",
      "Medium maintains paint strength and adhesion, while too much water weakens the paint film",
      "Water changes the color",
      "It doesn't matter which you use"
