      "text": "Blending methods: 1) Work fast with large brushes (beat the drying). 2) Use retarder medium (slows drying 15-30 minutes). 3) Mist with a spray bottle (keeps the surface workable). 4) Wet-on-dry layering (small overlapping strokes)."

      "text": "Optical blending: instead of physically blending two colors, place small strokes of each color side by side. From a distance, the eye blends them. The Impressionists used this — it creates vibrant, lively transitions."

      "text": "Dry-brush blending: load a dry brush with a tiny bit of paint and scrub it over the transition area. The paint catches on the texture of the canvas, creating a natural, broken blend that looks more interesting than a perfect gradient."
