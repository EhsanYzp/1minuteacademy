      "text": "Layering strategy: 1) Opaque underpainting (block in values and colors). 2) Transparent glazes (build color richness). 3) Opaque highlights (pop the brightest areas). This opaque-transparent-opaque sandwich creates depth."

      "text": "Glazing with acrylics: mix paint with glazing medium (keeps transparency without dilution). A blue glaze over a yellow base creates a luminous green that's richer than a mixed green because light bounces through separate color layers."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Unlike oil, acrylic glazes dry in minutes, so you can apply dozens of glazes in a single session. Oil painters wait DAYS between glazes. This speed lets acrylic painters build complex layered effects that would take oil painters weeks."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Paint a simple still life with an opaque underpainting. Once dry, apply 3-5 thin transparent glazes of different colors over different areas. The final painting will have a depth and luminosity that a single-layer painting can't match."

      "Acrylic glazes are more transparent",
      "Acrylic dries in minutes, allowing dozens of glazes in one session vs days between oil glazes",
      "Oil glazes are less colorful",
