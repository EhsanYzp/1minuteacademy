      "text": "CMYK is subtractive: inks absorb (subtract) light from white paper. Cyan absorbs red. Magenta absorbs green. Yellow absorbs blue. Mix all three and you get dark brown — which is why black (Key) is added."

      "text": "CMYK has a smaller gamut than RGB. Neon greens, electric blues, and vivid oranges on screen can't be reproduced in print. Designers must check CMYK previews before sending to press."

      "text": "K stands for 'Key' (the black plate that other plates are keyed/aligned to), not 'blacK' as commonly believed. The K plate also saves ink — using pure CMY for black would use three times the ink."

      "text": "Always design for your output. Digital-only? Use RGB for maximum vibrancy. Printing? Convert to CMYK early and adjust colors that fall outside the printable gamut."

    "options": [
      "For decorative borders",
