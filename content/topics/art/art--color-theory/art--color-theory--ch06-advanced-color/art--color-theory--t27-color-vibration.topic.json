      "text": "Vibration occurs when two complementary (or near-complementary) colors of similar value meet. Your eyes rapidly switch between perceiving each color, creating a visual buzz at the boundary."

      "text": "To stop vibration: change the value of one color, add a neutral separator between them, or reduce the saturation of one. A thin black or white line between vibrating colors calms them instantly."
