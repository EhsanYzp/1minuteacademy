      "text": "Seamless tiling: elements that cross one edge must continue perfectly from the opposite edge. The trick: draw motifs that cross the right edge, copy them to the left edge. Same for top/bottom. Then fill the center."

      "text": "Pattern types: regular repeat (simple grid), half-drop (offset rows — more organic), brick (offset columns), and random scatter (elements placed irregularly within a tiling structure). Half-drop is the most common for textiles."

      "text": "The hardest part of pattern design: hiding the repeat. If the viewer's eye spots where the tile repeats, the pattern looks mechanical. Varying element sizes, adding small 'filler' motifs, and using organic placement disguise the grid."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Design a simple pattern: draw a botanical motif, create a seamless tile (ensure edges align), then preview it tiled 3×3. Adjust spacing and add filler elements until the repeat is invisible. Your first seamless pattern is deeply satisfying."
