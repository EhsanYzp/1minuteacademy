      "text": "Your portfolio is your resume, your pitch, and your gallery in one. It's how clients decide whether to hire you — often in less than 30 seconds. A strong portfolio doesn't show everything you can do; it shows everything you do BEST."

      "text": "Portfolio rules: 10-15 of your BEST pieces (quality over quantity), consistent style (clients hire for a specific look), show the work you WANT to get (not just what you've done), and update regularly (remove old work as you improve)."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The portfolio paradox: you need clients to get work, but you need work to show clients. Solution: create personal projects that look like real commissions. Illustrate an imaginary children's book, redesign a magazine cover, create an app's icon set."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "A niche portfolio beats a general one: an illustrator who shows 15 amazing food illustrations gets hired for food editorial. An illustrator who shows food, cars, portraits, landscapes, and abstracts looks unfocused. Specialization wins."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Review your best work and select 12 pieces. Arrange them with your strongest piece first and second-strongest last. Remove anything that doesn't match the style of the rest. This editing is often harder — and more important — than creating the work."
    },
    "punchline": {
      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Your portfolio isn't a collection of your work. It's a statement about who you are as an illustrator. Curate ruthlessly."

    "question": "Why should an illustration portfolio show a consistent style rather than maximum variety?",
    "options": [
      "Clients like limited styles",
      "Clients hire for a specific look — a focused, consistent portfolio shows clear identity and expertise",
      "It's easier to build",
