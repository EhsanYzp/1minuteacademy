      "text": "Atmosphere tools: color temperature (warm = safe/inviting, cool = distant/mysterious), value contrast (high = dramatic/energetic, low = soft/dreamy), atmospheric perspective (distant objects lighter and bluer), and detail density (more detail = closer)."

      "text": "Atmospheric perspective: objects far away have less contrast, lighter values, and shift toward blue/gray. This mimics how air scatters light. Even in illustration, this effect makes backgrounds recede and creates convincing depth."

      "text": "Rule-breaking atmosphere can be powerful: a warm, well-lit scene with something wrong hidden in it (foreboding). A cold, dark scene with a warm light of hope. Contrast between atmosphere and content creates narrative tension."
