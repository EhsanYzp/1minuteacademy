      "text": "Props serve three functions: 1) Define the world (sci-fi tech vs medieval objects). 2) Reveal character (a neat desk vs a messy one). 3) Add visual interest (break up large empty areas, create focal points)."

      "text": "The 'lived-in' principle: real spaces are messy. An unworn coat draped on a chair, a half-read newspaper, shoes by the door — imperfect details make spaces feel occupied. Perfect, symmetrical rooms feel like showrooms, not homes."

      "text": "Every prop should be designable: what would a toaster look like in this world? A mailbox? A garbage can? Consistent prop design creates a coherent world. Inconsistent props break the illusion — a medieval scene with a modern chair pulls viewers out."
