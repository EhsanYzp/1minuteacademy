      "text": "A street that narrows into the distance. A room with correct proportions. A bird's-eye view of a town. Perspective is the system that makes flat drawings feel like real spaces — and it's essential for environment illustration."

      "text": "One-point: one vanishing point on the horizon (hallways, roads). Two-point: two vanishing points (building corners, street views). Three-point: three vanishing points (dramatic bird's-eye or worm's-eye views). More points = more dramatic."

      "text": "The horizon line is eye level. Everything above eye level, we look UP at. Everything below, we look DOWN at. Setting the horizon line low (worm's-eye) makes buildings monumental. Setting it high (bird's-eye) shows layout and space."

      "text": "Curvilinear (5-point) perspective mimics how we actually see — with slight warping at the edges. Fish-eye views and panoramic illustrations use this. It's more complex but creates immersive, wrap-around environments."
