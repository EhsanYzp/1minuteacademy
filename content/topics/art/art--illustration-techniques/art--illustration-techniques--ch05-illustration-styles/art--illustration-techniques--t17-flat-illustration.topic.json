      "text": "Open any app, website, or tech company blog: flat illustration is everywhere. Bold shapes, flat colors, simple forms, geometric compositions. It's the visual language of modern commercial design — and it's more intentional than it looks."

      "text": "Flat illustration principles: geometric shapes over organic forms, limited color palette (5-8 colors), no gradients or shadows (or minimal), consistent stroke weight, and simplified anatomy. Clarity and graphic impact over realism."

      "text": "Why flat works: it scales perfectly (icons to billboards), it's culturally neutral (simple forms cross language barriers), it loads fast (simple vectors = small files), and it's cohesive (easy to maintain a consistent look across many illustrations)."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Flat illustration's simplicity is deceptive — choosing what to REMOVE is harder than adding detail. Every shape must communicate. Every color choice matters more because there are fewer of them. Constraint is the creative challenge."
