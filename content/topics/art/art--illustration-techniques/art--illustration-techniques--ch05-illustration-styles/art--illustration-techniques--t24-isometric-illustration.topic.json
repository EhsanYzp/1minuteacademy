      "text": "Isometric illustration shows 3D objects from a fixed angle (roughly 30°) with no vanishing points — parallel lines stay parallel. It creates a charming, toy-like 3D look that's perfect for infographics, games, and tech illustration."

      "visual": "📐",
      "text": "The isometric grid: lines run at 30° angles from horizontal. All vertical lines stay vertical. Objects don't get smaller with distance (no perspective). This creates a consistent, modular look where everything fits together like building blocks."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Isometric is modular: once you design one building, you can tile it. One tree can be duplicated into a forest. This modularity makes it perfect for creating complex cityscapes, technical diagrams, and game maps efficiently."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Because there's no perspective shrinking, isometric scenes feel like miniatures — like looking at a model or a toy. This charming quality is why it's beloved in video games (SimCity, Monument Valley) and infographic design."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Draw a simple room in isometric: a cube for the room, with a bed, desk, and bookshelf inside. Use a 30° grid guide. The consistent angle makes every object feel like it belongs in the same dollhouse-like space."

      "text": "Isometric: all the charm of 3D, none of the vanishing-point math. It's 3D for people who love grids."

      "It uses vanishing points",
