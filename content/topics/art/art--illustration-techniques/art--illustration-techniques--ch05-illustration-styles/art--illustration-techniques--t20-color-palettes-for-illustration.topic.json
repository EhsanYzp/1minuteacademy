      "text": "The 60-30-10 rule: 60% dominant color (background, large areas), 30% secondary color (supporting elements), 10% accent color (focal points, details). This ratio creates balance with a clear visual hierarchy."

      "text": "Restrict yourself to 3-4 colors and you'll be forced to use value (light/dark) to differentiate elements. This constraint often produces better results than unlimited colors because it creates automatic harmony."
