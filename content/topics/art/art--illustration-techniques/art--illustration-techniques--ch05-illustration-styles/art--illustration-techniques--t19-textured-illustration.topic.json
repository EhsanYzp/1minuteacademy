      "visual": "🧱",
      "text": "Flat digital art can feel sterile. Add a paper texture overlay, grain in the shadows, and rough brush edges — suddenly it feels handmade, warm, and personal. Texture adds the human touch that pure vector lacks."

      "text": "Texture sources: paper grain overlays, textured brushes, noise filters, scanned textures (watercolor paper, canvas, cardboard), and halftone patterns. Applied subtly, they add depth. Applied heavily, they define the entire style."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Layer texture strategically: heavier texture in shadows (grounds them), lighter texture on illuminated areas (keeps them bright), and no texture on highlights (maintains their glow). This creates a natural-looking texture gradient."

      "text": "Texture can unify disparate elements: characters, backgrounds, and props that were drawn separately feel like one cohesive piece when they share the same texture treatment. It's visual glue that binds an illustration together."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Take a flat digital illustration and add texture: paper grain overlay (multiply mode, low opacity), textured brush for shadows, and rough edges on shapes. Before/after comparison will show how texture transforms digital sterility into warmth."
