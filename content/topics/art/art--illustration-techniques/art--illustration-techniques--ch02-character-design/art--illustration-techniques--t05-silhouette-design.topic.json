      "text": "Silhouette tests: unique outline (distinguishable from other characters), readable pose (you can tell what they're doing), personality visible (posture and proportions communicate character traits). If the silhouette fails, add detail won't save it."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The trick: exaggerate defining features. A wizard's hat should be VERY pointed. A warrior's shoulders should be VERY broad. A child's head should be proportionally VERY large. Exaggeration makes silhouettes distinctive and memorable."
