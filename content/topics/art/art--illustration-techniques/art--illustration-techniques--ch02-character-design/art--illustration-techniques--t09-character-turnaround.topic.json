      "text": "Front view, side view, back view, three-quarter view — a turnaround sheet shows a character from every angle. It's the blueprint that keeps a character looking consistent across dozens of illustrations or animation frames."

      "visual": "📐",
      "text": "Standard turnaround: front, 3/4 front, side, 3/4 back, back. All views at the same height, with horizontal guidelines for key features (top of head, eyes, chin, shoulders, hips, knees, feet) to maintain proportion across views."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The challenge: features that are obvious from the front (face shape, chest markings) may be invisible from the side. Side view reveals nose profile, ear shape, and hairstyle depth. Each view teaches you more about the character."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Many illustrators design characters from their favorite angle (usually 3/4 front) and struggle when drawing other views. Creating a turnaround EARLY forces you to understand the character's 3D form, making all future drawings easier."
    },

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Design a simple character and create a 5-view turnaround with horizontal guidelines. You'll discover that the character you imagined in 2D doesn't fully exist in 3D — the turnaround process reveals and resolves these gaps."

      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "A turnaround sheet is a character's passport. It proves the character exists in 3D, not just from one lucky angle."

      "It's only for animation",
