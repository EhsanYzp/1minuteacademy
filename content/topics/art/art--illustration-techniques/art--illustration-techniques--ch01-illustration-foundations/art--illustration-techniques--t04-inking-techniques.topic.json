      "text": "Inking is the transformation: a rough pencil sketch becomes clean, bold, and confident. Comic artists, tattoo designers, and children's book illustrators all rely on inking to turn sketches into finished art."

      "text": "Techniques: hatching (parallel lines for shadow), cross-hatching (crossed lines for darker values), stippling (dots for texture), contour lines (lines following form), and solid fills (flat black areas for drama)."

      "text": "The secret to clean inking: draw from the shoulder, not the wrist. Long, confident strokes from the shoulder are smoother and more intentional. Short wrist movements create scratchy, uncertain lines. Practice ghosting the stroke before committing."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Digital inking has undo — which seems like an advantage but can be a trap. Illustrators who ink traditionally develop more confident strokes because there's no undo. Consider doing occasional traditional inking to build hand confidence."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Take a pencil sketch and ink it using three techniques in different areas: hatching for shadows, solid fills for the darkest parts, and clean contour lines for forms. The combination creates richness that no single technique achieves alone."

      "text": "Inking isn't tracing your sketch. It's interpreting it — deciding what stays, what goes, and what becomes bold."

  "quiz": {
    "question": "Why should inking strokes come from the shoulder rather than the wrist?",
    "options": [
      "Shoulder strokes use less ink",
      "Shoulder strokes produce longer, smoother, more confident lines",
      "Wrist strokes are too dark",
      "It doesn't matter which you use"
