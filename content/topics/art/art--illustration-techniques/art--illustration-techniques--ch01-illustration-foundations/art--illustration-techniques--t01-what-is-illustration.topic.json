      "text": "Illustration bridges text and image — it communicates ideas that words alone can't. A medical textbook needs anatomical illustrations. A fantasy novel needs a cover that captures the world. A website needs icons that guide navigation."

      "text": "The key difference from fine art: illustration serves a communication goal. An illustrator asks 'what does this need to say?' before asking 'what do I want to express?' The message comes first; the style supports it."
