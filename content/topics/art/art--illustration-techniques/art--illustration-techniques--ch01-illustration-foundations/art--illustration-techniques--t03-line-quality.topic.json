      "text": "A uniform line is monotonous. A line that swells and tapers — thick at curves, thin at ends — has life and energy. Line quality is the illustrator's handwriting: it conveys confidence, mood, and dimension."

      "text": "Line weight rules: thicker lines for outlines and near objects (advances toward viewer). Thinner lines for interior details and far objects (recedes). Thick-to-thin variation at curves creates 3D form from 2D lines."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Different tools create different line quality: pen nibs flex for thick/thin variation. Brushes give smooth, calligraphic strokes. Felt tips produce uniform weight. Digital tools simulate any physical tool. Choose the line quality that matches your mood."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Line weight hierarchy: outer contour (heaviest), form shadows (medium), surface details (lightest). This three-tier system creates an automatic sense of depth and importance — the viewer reads heavier lines as more important."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Draw the same simple character twice: once with uniform line weight, once with varied line weight (thick outlines, thin details, weight at curves). The varied version will look more professional and dimensional — even with identical shapes."

      "text": "Line quality separates amateur from professional. A single line, drawn with intention, can have more personality than a detailed rendering."
