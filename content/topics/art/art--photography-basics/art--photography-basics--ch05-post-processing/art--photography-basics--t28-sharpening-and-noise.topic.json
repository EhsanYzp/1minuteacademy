      "text": "Sharpening: increases edge contrast to make details look crisp. Applied in small amounts — too much creates halos and artifacts. Noise reduction: smooths random grain — too much creates a waxy, detail-less look."

      "text": "The trade-off: sharpening enhances detail but also enhances noise. Noise reduction removes noise but also softens detail. They're opposing forces. The art is finding the balance where detail is crisp and noise is controlled."

      "text": "Compare: a RAW file with no sharpening (soft), light sharpening (crisp), and heavy sharpening (crunchy with halos). Then view at actual display size rather than 200% zoom. The light sharpening always looks best at normal viewing distance."
