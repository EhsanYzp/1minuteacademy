      "text": "JPEG: the camera processes the image, compresses it, and throws away data. RAW: the camera saves ALL the data the sensor captured — unprocessed, uncompressed. JPEG is a print. RAW is the negative."

      "text": "RAW files are 3-5x larger but contain 12-14 bits of data per pixel vs JPEG's 8 bits. This means: more shadow detail, more highlight detail, more color information, and the ability to fix white balance and exposure after shooting."
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "RAW is forgiving: overexposed highlights can often be recovered. Underexposed shadows can be lifted. White balance can be changed perfectly. With JPEG, these corrections degrade quality because the data was already compressed."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "RAW files need processing — they look flat and dull straight from camera. JPEGs look good immediately because the camera applied contrast, saturation, and sharpening. RAW requires more work but offers more potential."

      "text": "Take the same photo in RAW+JPEG. Deliberately underexpose by 2 stops. In editing, brighten both by 2 stops. The RAW will look clean. The JPEG will show banding, noise, and color shifts. RAW's extra data saves the shot."
