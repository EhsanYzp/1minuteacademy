      "text": "Blue hour: ~20-40 minutes after sunset (or before sunrise). The sky acts as a giant blue fill light that illuminates buildings, streets, and landscapes without the harshness of midday or the total darkness of night."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Why it's magic: during blue hour, artificial lights (warm) contrast beautifully against the blue sky (cool). This warm/cool contrast creates rich, vibrant cityscapes that pure nighttime (dark sky) can't match."

      "text": "Blue hour requires a tripod — exposures can be 1-30 seconds. But the long exposure is a bonus: car headlights become light trails, water becomes silky, and crowds blur into ghosts. The technical limitation becomes an artistic opportunity."

      "text": "Find a city viewpoint with a tripod. Start shooting at sunset and continue for 40 minutes. Watch the transition: warm sunset → purple twilight → rich blue hour → dark night. Blue hour will produce your best frame."
