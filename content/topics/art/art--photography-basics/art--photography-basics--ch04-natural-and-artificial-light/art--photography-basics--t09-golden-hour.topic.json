      "text": "The hour after sunrise and the hour before sunset: light turns warm gold, shadows stretch long, everything glows. Photographers call it 'golden hour' — and it's not hype. The light is genuinely transformative."

      "visual": "☀️",
      "text": "Why it works: the sun is low, so light travels through more atmosphere, which filters out blue wavelengths (leaving warm tones) and scatters the light (creating soft shadows). The combination is universally flattering."

      "text": "Golden hour light wraps around subjects, creating gentle shadows that reveal form without harsh contrast. Skin glows warm. Landscapes look painterly. Backlighting creates rim light and lens flares. Everything looks better."
