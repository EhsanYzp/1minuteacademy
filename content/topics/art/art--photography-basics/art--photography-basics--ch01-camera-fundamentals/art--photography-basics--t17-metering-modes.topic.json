      "text": "Your camera has a built-in light meter that measures the scene and suggests exposure settings. But it can be fooled: a snow scene underexposes (camera sees 'too bright'), a dark scene overexposes (camera sees 'too dark')."

      "text": "Metering modes: evaluative/matrix (analyzes entire scene — works 90% of the time), center-weighted (prioritizes center area), spot (measures only a tiny area — precise control). Each handles tricky lighting differently."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Cameras assume every scene averages to middle gray. Snow (very bright) gets darkened to gray. A black cat (very dark) gets brightened to gray. When you know this, you can add exposure compensation to correct it."

      "text": "Spot metering is the pro's tool: meter the subject's face (regardless of background brightness) and expose for that. A backlit portrait with a bright sky? Spot meter the face and let the sky blow out. The face matters most."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Photograph a subject against a bright window in evaluative mode (face goes dark) then switch to spot metering on the face (face correct, window blows out). Metering choice determines WHAT in the scene gets correct exposure."
