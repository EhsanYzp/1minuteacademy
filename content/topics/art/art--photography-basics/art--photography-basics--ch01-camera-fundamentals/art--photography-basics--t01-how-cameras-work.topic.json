      "text": "A camera is a light-tight box with a hole. Light enters through the hole, passes through a lens, and hits a sensor (or film). That's it. Every camera from a pinhole to a $50,000 cinema rig works on this same principle."

      "visual": "🔦",
      "text": "Three components: the lens (focuses light), the shutter (controls how long light hits the sensor), and the sensor/film (records the light pattern). Together they capture a moment of light and freeze it."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The sensor converts light photons into electrical signals, which become pixels. More photons = brighter pixel. Different wavelengths = different colors. Millions of tiny light measurements, assembled into an image."

      "text": "Your phone camera works identically to a DSLR — same physics, same principles. The difference is sensor size, lens quality, and controls. Understanding how cameras work makes you better with ANY camera, including your phone."

      "text": "Try this: make a pinhole camera from a box and aluminum foil. Poke a tiny hole, point it at a bright scene, and look at the back wall — you'll see an inverted image. That's photography reduced to its essence."
