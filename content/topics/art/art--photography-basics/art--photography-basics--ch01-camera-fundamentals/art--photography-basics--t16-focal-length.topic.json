      "text": "50mm is the 'normal' lens — it roughly matches human field of view. Start here and learn to see in one focal length. Zoom with your feet. This constraint forces better composition more than any zoom lens."

      "text": "Focal length affects perspective: wide angles exaggerate distance (near objects HUGE, far objects tiny). Telephotos compress distance (everything looks stacked). Portraits look most natural at 85-135mm because the compression flatters faces."

      "text": "Photograph a face at 24mm up close and at 100mm from farther away, filling the frame similarly. The wide angle distorts features (big nose, small ears). The telephoto flatters (proportional, compressed). Same face, different lenses, different person."
