      "text": "Landscape essentials: wide-angle lens (14-35mm), tripod (for sharpness and slow shutter speeds), small aperture (f/8-f/16 for deep focus), and golden/blue hour timing (flat midday light kills landscapes)."

      "text": "The key: foreground interest. Without something interesting in the foreground (rocks, flowers, patterns), wide-angle landscapes feel empty. Strong foreground + middle ground + background = three layers of depth."
