      "text": "Horizon on the top third = more foreground. Horizon on the bottom third = more sky. Subject at a side intersection = natural feel with space to look into. Subject dead center = static and formal."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The rule works because off-center placement creates visual tension — the viewer's eye moves between the subject and the surrounding space. It turns a snapshot into a composition."
    },

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "The rule is a training wheel, not a commandment. As you develop your eye, you'll find compositions that work at center, at extreme edges, or that defy any grid. The rule gets you started; instinct takes you further."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Take the same scene: shoot it with the subject centered, then at each of the four intersection points. Compare all five. The centered shot will feel different — not always worse, but definitely more static."

    "question": "Why does placing a subject off-center often create a stronger photograph?",
    "options": [
      "Off-center is always correct",
      "It creates visual tension that engages the viewer as their eye moves between subject and space",
      "It makes the camera focus better",
