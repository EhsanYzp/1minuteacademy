      "text": "ISO is volume for light. Low ISO (100-400): clean, detailed images in good light. High ISO (3200+): bright images in darkness, but with grain/noise — like turning up volume on a quiet recording."

      "text": "ISO 100: base sensitivity, cleanest quality. Each doubling (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400) doubles sensitivity but increases noise. Modern cameras handle ISO 3200 well; older cameras struggle above 800."
