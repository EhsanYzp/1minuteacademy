      "text": "Every photo's brightness is controlled by exactly three things: how wide the hole is (aperture), how long it's open (shutter speed), and how sensitive the sensor is (ISO). Master these three and you control light."

      "visual": "📐",
      "text": "Aperture (f-stop): wider hole = more light. Shutter speed: longer open = more light. ISO: higher number = more sensitivity = more light. Each doubles/halves the light in standard increments called 'stops.'"
    },
    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The key insight: they're interconnected. If you widen the aperture (+1 stop of light), you can use a faster shutter speed (-1 stop) and get the same brightness. It's a balancing act with creative trade-offs."
    },
    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Each setting has a side effect: wider aperture = shallower depth of field (blurry background). Longer shutter = motion blur. Higher ISO = more grain/noise. Choosing exposure is choosing which creative side effect you want."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Take the same photo three times with the same brightness: 1) wide aperture + fast shutter (blurry background), 2) narrow aperture + slow shutter (everything sharp), 3) high ISO + fast everything (grainy but frozen). Same light, different looks."
