      "text": "A photograph flattens the world into 2D. Real life is 3D, has atmosphere, changes with your viewpoint, and offers infinite detail. Drawing from life trains your eyes in ways photos never can."

      "text": "Life drawing advantages: you see true 3D form (not flattened), you choose what to emphasize, you see subtle color and value changes cameras miss, and you develop stronger observational skills."

      "text": "Start simple: draw objects in your home (cups, shoes, fruit). Then venture outside (trees, buildings, people on benches). The subject doesn't matter — the observation practice does."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Photos are useful reference, but artists who only draw from photos develop a 'photographic' look — flat lighting, frozen moments, camera distortion. Life drawing avoids all of these traps."

      "text": "Sit at a coffee shop. Draw the scene: the barista, the pastry case, the customer reading. You have 20 minutes before your subject moves. That time pressure creates energetic, expressive work."
