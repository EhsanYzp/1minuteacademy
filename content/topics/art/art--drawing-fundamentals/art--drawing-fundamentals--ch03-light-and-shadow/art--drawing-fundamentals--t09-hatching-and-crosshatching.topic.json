      "text": "Hatching: parallel lines create value. Closer lines = darker. Farther apart = lighter. Crosshatching: add a second layer of lines at a different angle. Each layer darkens the value."

      "text": "Line direction matters: lines that follow the form's contour (contour hatching) make objects look three-dimensional. Straight horizontal hatching flattens. Curved hatching creates volume."

      "text": "Crosshatching builds value gradually. You can go darker by adding layers, but you can't go lighter. Start light and build up — it's easier to add darkness than to remove it."
