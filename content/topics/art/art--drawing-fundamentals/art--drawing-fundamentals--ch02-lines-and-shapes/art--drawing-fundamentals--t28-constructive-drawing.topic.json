      "text": "The process: (1) Identify the basic 3D form (cylinder for arm, box for torso). (2) Draw the 3D form in perspective. (3) Carve details into the form. (4) Refine with contour lines on top."

      "text": "Constructive drawing means you draw THROUGH the object — you sketch the back side even though you can't see it. This forces you to understand the full 3D form, not just the visible surface."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "This approach lets you draw objects from any angle, from imagination. Since you understand the 3D structure, you can rotate it mentally and draw it from a viewpoint you've never seen."
