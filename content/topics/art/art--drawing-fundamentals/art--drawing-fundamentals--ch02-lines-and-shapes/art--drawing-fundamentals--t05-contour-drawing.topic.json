      "text": "Contour drawing captures the outline (outer contour) and inner edges (inner contours — wrinkles, folds, surface changes). It trains the eye-hand connection: see an edge, draw that edge."

      "text": "The common mistake: drawing too fast. Contour drawing should be slow. Your pencil speed should match your eye speed as it traces the edge. Slow observation = accurate drawing."

      "text": "Try a 5-minute blind contour of your hand. Don't look at the paper. Follow every wrinkle, nail edge, and knuckle fold with your eyes. The drawing will be delightfully wonky — and your observation muscles will be stronger."
