      "text": "A dancer mid-leap. A cat stretching. A person reaching for a book. Gesture drawing captures the movement and energy of a subject in 30 seconds to 2 minutes — no detail, pure action."

      "text": "Start with the line of action: a single curved line that captures the dominant direction of the pose. Then quickly block in the major body masses: head, ribcage, pelvis. Connect them with flowing lines."

      "text": "Gesture isn't about accuracy — it's about feeling. A good gesture drawing is alive and energetic even though it's barely recognizable. It captures what a photograph misses: the sense of motion."

      "text": "Stiff figure drawing is almost always caused by skipping gesture. If you go straight to anatomy and proportion without establishing gesture first, your figure will look like a posed mannequin."

      "text": "Use a pose reference site (like Line of Action). Set a 30-second timer. Draw the line of action and major shapes before the timer runs out. Do 20 in a row. It's transformative."
