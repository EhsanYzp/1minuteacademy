      "text": "Thick lines: heavy, grounded, close. Thin lines: delicate, distant, secondary. The convention: thicker lines for outer contours and shadow sides, thinner lines for inner details and light sides."

      "text": "Line weight creates hierarchy. The thickest lines define the silhouette and grab attention. Medium lines describe important inner details. The thinnest lines suggest texture and subtlety."

      "text": "A single line can vary in weight: start thin, press harder in the middle, lift at the end. This 'calligraphic' line quality adds elegance and expression to every stroke."

      "text": "Draw any object twice: once with uniform line weight, once with varied weight (thick on shadow side, thin on light side, thick for contour, thin for details). Compare. The varied version wins."
