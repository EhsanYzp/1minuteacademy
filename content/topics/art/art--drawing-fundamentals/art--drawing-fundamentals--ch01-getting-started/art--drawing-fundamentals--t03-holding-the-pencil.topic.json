      "text": "Writing grip (tripod): precise, controlled — good for detail work and small marks. Overhand grip: pencil rests on fingers, thumb on top — produces loose, gestural strokes from the shoulder."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "The overhand grip forces you to draw from the elbow and shoulder instead of the wrist. This produces smoother, longer lines and prevents the 'cramped' look of wrist-only drawing."

      "text": "Most drawing problems are actually grip problems. Tight, scratchy lines? Probably gripping too hard. Wobbly curves? Probably drawing from the wrist. Switch grips and the problem often vanishes."
