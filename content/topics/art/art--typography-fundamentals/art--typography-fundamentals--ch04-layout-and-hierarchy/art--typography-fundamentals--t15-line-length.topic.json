      "text": "A line of text stretching across a full widescreen monitor is exhausting to read. A line squeezed into 20 characters is choppy. Line length — called 'measure' — has a sweet spot: 45-75 characters per line."

      "text": "The guideline: 45-75 characters per line (including spaces) for body text. ~66 characters is the classic ideal. Too long: the eye loses its place returning to the next line. Too short: too many line breaks disrupt reading rhythm."

      "text": "This is why books have margins, newspapers have columns, and websites have max-width containers. They're all controlling measure. A full-width paragraph on a large screen can exceed 150 characters — unreadable."
