      "text": "Create clear jumps between levels. If your H1 is 48px and H2 is 42px, they're ambiguous. Make it 48px vs 32px — a clear difference. Each level should be unmistakably different from the next."

      "text": "You don't always need bigger = more important. A small, bold, colored label can outrank a large gray heading. Hierarchy isn't just size — it's the total visual weight combining size, color, contrast, and whitespace."

      "text": "Define a type scale: pick 4-5 sizes (e.g., 12, 16, 24, 36, 48px), assign roles (caption, body, subhead, head, display), and use them consistently. This system creates instant, reliable hierarchy."
