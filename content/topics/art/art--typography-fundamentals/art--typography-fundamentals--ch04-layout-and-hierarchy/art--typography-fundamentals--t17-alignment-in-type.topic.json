      "text": "Left-aligned (ragged right): consistent left edge, natural word spacing. The default for most reading. Right-aligned: unusual, hard to read for long text, useful for design accents. Centered: no strong edge, formal but hard to scan. Justified: both edges aligned, professional but risks ugly word spacing."

      "text": "Left-aligned text works because the consistent left edge gives the eye a reliable return point after each line. The ragged right edge actually helps readability — each line has a unique shape, making it easier to track."

      "text": "Justified text looks polished but creates 'rivers' — visible streams of white space running vertically through paragraphs when word spacing stretches unevenly. Good justification requires hyphenation and careful line-breaking."
