      "text": "Block spacing: a blank line (or half-line) between paragraphs. Used on web, email, and business documents. Clean and explicit. Indentation: first line indented (1 em typically). Used in books and long-form print. Compact and elegant."

      "text": "Block spacing works for scanned content (web, presentations) — the gaps make paragraphs clearly separate units. Indentation works for continuous reading (novels, essays) — it signals new paragraphs without interrupting the flow."
