      "text": "Look at the letter 'O' in Bodoni: the vertical strokes are thick, the horizontal strokes are hairline thin. Now look at Futura's 'O': nearly uniform thickness. Stroke contrast defines a typeface's visual DNA."

      "text": "High contrast (Bodoni, Didot): dramatic thick/thin variation — elegant, fashion, classical. Low contrast (Futura, Helvetica): uniform stroke weight — modern, geometric, stable. Medium contrast (Times): balanced and neutral."

      "text": "Stroke contrast comes from calligraphy: a broad-nib pen naturally creates thick downstrokes and thin cross-strokes. Typefaces with high contrast echo the pen. Geometric typefaces reject the pen entirely."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "High-contrast typefaces look stunning at large sizes but can become unreadable at small sizes — the thin strokes disappear. This is why Bodoni works for magazine headers but not for body text on phones."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Compare 'Bodoni' (extreme contrast) and 'Helvetica' (minimal contrast) side by side at the same size. The personality difference is dramatic — and it comes entirely from how thick and thin strokes relate to each other."
