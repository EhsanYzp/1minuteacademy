      "text": "Tracking (letter-spacing): positive tracking spreads letters apart (airy, elegant, good for uppercase headings). Negative tracking tightens them (dense, urgent). Leading (line-height): more leading = more breathing room between lines."

      "text": "Body text sweet spots: tracking near zero (default), leading at 120-150% of font size (1.2-1.5 line-height). Too tight = claustrophobic. Too loose = disconnected. The reader should never notice the spacing."

      "text": "Luxury brands love wide tracking on uppercase text: 'C H A N E L.' It feels spacious, exclusive, unhurried. Dense tracking feels urgent, tabloid, cramped. Spacing communicates social class."
