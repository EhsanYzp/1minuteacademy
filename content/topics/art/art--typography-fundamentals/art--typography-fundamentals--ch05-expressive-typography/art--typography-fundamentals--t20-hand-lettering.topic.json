      "text": "Hand lettering isn't handwriting — it's drawing letters. Each letterform is carefully constructed, sketched, refined, and polished. The result: type that feels human, unique, and impossible to replicate with a font."

      "text": "Process: 1) Sketch rough letter shapes (pencil). 2) Refine proportions and spacing. 3) Ink final forms. 4) Digitize if needed. Tools: brush pens, pointed pens, flat-edged nibs, chalk, or digital brushes."

      "text": "Hand lettering adds what fonts can't: personality, imperfection, and soul. A hand-lettered café sign, book cover, or wedding invitation carries emotional warmth that no typed font can match."

    "twist": {
      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Good hand lettering requires understanding typography. You need to know letter proportions, spacing rules, and structural consistency BEFORE breaking them expressively. Freedom comes from knowledge, not ignorance."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Letter your name in three styles: formal script (elegant connections), block letters (bold and structured), and casual brush (loose and energetic). Each requires different tools and techniques — same letters, completely different vibes."

      "visual": "🎬",
      "text": "Hand lettering is where typography meets illustration. Every stroke is both a letter and a brushmark."
