      "text": "Typographic color (the gray tone): determined by typeface weight, letter spacing, line spacing, and font size. Squint at a text block — it should look like an even gray rectangle, not a patchy mess."

      "text": "Literal color: dark text on light backgrounds is easiest to read (black on white is the gold standard). For reverse (light on dark), use slightly increased letter spacing and heavier weight — thin type disappears on dark backgrounds."

      "text": "Pure black (#000000) on pure white (#FFFFFF) is actually harder to read than dark gray (#333) on off-white (#F5F5F5). The extreme contrast causes eye strain. Slightly reduced contrast is more comfortable for extended reading."
