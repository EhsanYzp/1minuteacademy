      "text": "The power: the viewer simultaneously reads the word AND sees the image. This dual processing creates stronger memorability than either text or image alone. Logos exploit this: the hidden arrow in FedEx."

      "text": "There's a tipping point: push too far and the type becomes illegible. The art is making the word readable AND visually expressive. If you have to explain what the word says, you've gone too far."

      "text": "Take a single word that describes something physical (DRIP, SHARP, HEAVY, FLOW) and set it in a way that the letterforms LOOK like the word's meaning. The typography becomes illustration."
