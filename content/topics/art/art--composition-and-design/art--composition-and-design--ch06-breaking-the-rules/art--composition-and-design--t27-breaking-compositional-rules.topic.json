      "text": "The difference between intentional and accidental rule-breaking is knowledge. If you break the rule of thirds because you don't know it, that's ignorance. If you break it because centering serves this specific subject, that's mastery."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "Breaking a rule creates surprise BECAUSE the viewer unconsciously expects the rule to be followed. A centered subject is powerful because most things are off-center. An extreme crop is dynamic because most things are uncropped. Context creates the impact."
