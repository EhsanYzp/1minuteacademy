      "visual": "🐍",
      "text": "A winding river through a valley. A curving road through hills. The S-curve is one of the most pleasing compositional shapes — it creates graceful, organic flow that the eye loves to follow."

      "visual": "〰️",
      "text": "The S-curve (or serpentine line) creates alternating curves that lead the eye through the composition in a meandering, natural path. It's more dynamic than a straight line and more elegant than a zigzag."

      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Landscape painters use S-curves constantly: a river winding from foreground to background, a path curving through a field, a coastline bending in alternating arcs. Each curve creates a new mini-composition."

      "visual": "⚡",
      "text": "The S-curve works in figure drawing too. The 'contrapposto' pose — weight on one leg, hips and shoulders tilted — creates an S-curve through the body that's been considered graceful since ancient Greece."

      "It's the only curved line",
