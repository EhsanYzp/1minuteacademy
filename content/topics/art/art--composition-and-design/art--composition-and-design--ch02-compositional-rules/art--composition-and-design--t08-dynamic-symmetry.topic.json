      "text": "Jay Hambidge discovered that many masterworks align with a system of diagonal lines called dynamic symmetry. It's more complex than the rule of thirds but creates sophisticated, rhythmic compositions."

      "text": "The basic armature: draw diagonals corner-to-corner. Then draw lines from each corner to the midpoint of the opposite side. The intersections and lines create a web of natural placement guides."

    "discovery": {
      "visual": "💡",
      "text": "Classical painters like Bouguereau and Sorolla used these diagonals. Key elements — eyes, horizon lines, figure edges — fall along these armature lines with striking consistency."

      "text": "You don't need to calculate it during painting. The armature is a checking tool: lay it over a rough composition and see if major elements align with any diagonals. Adjust if they don't."

      "visual": "🏁",
      "text": "Draw the basic armature (corner-to-corner diagonals plus reciprocals) over your next thumbnail. Shift major elements to align with the lines. The composition will feel more unified and rhythmic."
