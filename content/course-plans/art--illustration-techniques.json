        "discovery": { "visual": "💡", "text": "The secret to clean inking: draw from the shoulder, not the wrist. Long, confident strokes from the shoulder are smoother and more intentional. Short wrist movements create scratchy, uncertain lines. Practice ghosting the stroke before committing." },
        "twist": { "visual": "⚡", "text": "Digital inking has undo — which seems like an advantage but can be a trap. Illustrators who ink traditionally develop more confident strokes because there's no undo. Consider doing occasional traditional inking to build hand confidence." },
        "climax": { "visual": "🏁", "text": "Take a pencil sketch and ink it using three techniques in different areas: hatching for shadows, solid fills for the darkest parts, and clean contour lines for forms. The combination creates richness that no single technique achieves alone." },

        "discovery": { "visual": "💡", "text": "Shape language works because of psychological associations: round things in nature are usually safe (fruits, babies' faces). Sharp things are dangerous (thorns, fangs, cliffs). Our brains read shapes as signals BEFORE we read them as drawings." },

        "twist": { "visual": "⚡", "text": "Asymmetry adds life: one eyebrow raised higher than the other suggests questioning or skepticism. A half-smile (one corner up) reads as wry or uncertain. Real faces are asymmetrical — illustrated ones should be too." },
